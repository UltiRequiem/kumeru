# Contributing to Kumeru

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Adding examples

Even "Hello World!" examples using a bundler not used yet in the examples are
welcome!

e.g Example using it with Webpack, Rollup, etc.

## Adding/Proposing new Features

If you have an idea that you think it would be cool to have here but don't
know/want to implement it, leave an issue so we can discus it.

If you know how to implement it, open an issue to track and discus the feature
and a normal PR.
